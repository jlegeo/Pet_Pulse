# Pet_Pulse
PETPULSE is a real-time pet stress detection system using AI. It analyzes pet vocalizations and combines them with simulated vital signs—like heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature—to classify stress levels. Built with Python, TensorFlow, and Streamlit, the system uses deep learning to provide instant predictions and alerts based on audio input.
